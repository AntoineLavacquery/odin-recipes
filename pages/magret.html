    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 duck breasts</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>A knob of butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Use a very sharp knife to score the skin on each duck breast, cutting
        1⁄2" diamonds across the entire surface.
      </li>
      <li>Season all over with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>
        Add the duck breasts to the pan, skin side down, and cook for 5 to 6
        minutes, until plenty of fat has rendered and the skin is a deep golden
        brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip the breasts and cook for another 8-10 minutes for medium-rare (rosy
        in the middle), or longer if you want it cooked more.
      </li>
    </ol>
