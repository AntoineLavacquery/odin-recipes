Sure, here is a quick recipe for Duck Breast (Magret de Canard) in English:

**Ingredients:**
- 2 duck breasts
- Salt and pepper
- A knob of butter

**Instructions:**
1. Use a very sharp knife to score the skin on each duck breast, cutting 1⁄2" diamonds across the entire surface³.
2. Season all over with salt and pepper³.
3. Add the duck breasts to the pan, skin side down, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until plenty of fat has rendered and the skin is a deep golden brown³.
4. Flip the breasts and cook for another 8-10 minutes for medium-rare (rosy in the middle), or longer if you want it cooked more².

Enjoy your meal! 😊
